                        <p>Hi guys! My name is Guneet and this is my first blog and first time using HTML and CSS. I am very exited to share things about myself, my favourite hobbies and favourite foods. I have never made a blog about myself before or shared alot of information about me before on the web so this will also be my first time doing that too. Hope you enjoy! </p>

                        <p>I'd like to start this blog with three facts about me. The first fact is that I Love horror movies! I don't have a particular favourite and I find new ones all the time but I am a fan of classics such as Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween! I will always be up for watching a horror movie. Even the really scary ones!</p>
                        <p>The second fact about me is that I love the colours blue and grey! They are the colours of my room and they are very calming. I would also like to wear grey and blue even though I don't usually wear them but I think they would suit me!</p>
                        <p>The third fact about me is that I am very sporty! I played many sports when I was younger such as.... tennis, swmming, basketball, netball, table tennis, cross country, football, jiu jitsu... and many more!</p>
                        <p>Bonus fact: I love dogs! They are very cute and very friendly. I also do like cats.</p>

                        <p>There are many favourite foods that I have and I would like to share them. The first favourite food that I enjoy is pizza! Most people enjoy pizza and so do I. There are many different toppings you can add to personalise your pizza and the tomato base is so yummy! </p>
                        
                        <p>The second food I would like to list is another Italian classic which is bruschetta. Even though this is classed as a side or a starter, it is a fairly simple dish and tastes amazing! As Adam from Inspired Taste likes to say:</p> 
                            <blockquote>
                                "When I see fresh tomatoes, my mind immediately turns to bruschetta." - <cite>Adam from Inspired Taste</cite>

                        <p>My absolute favourite food of all time has got to be sushi. You either love it or hate it but so far I have never had a single bad experience with sushi. The texture of rice with the seaweed. Not to mention it can fairly good for your health, particularly the gut.</p>

                        <p> I have many hobbies that I would like to share with you! Currently I play badminton with my friends and go swimming from time to time. I enjoy keeping myself fit and healthy, eating all the right foods and exercising is important to me. Although I do not think I would be able to master as many sports as I did when I was younger :(</p>

                        <p>Since I was in secondary school I have been a fan of origiami and I usually practice when I am home in my room. I find this hobby to be very calming and it also helps me to clear my mind if I am feeling stressed. There are many useful origami projects I have made in my past and continue to make. Some of these include: storage boxes, lamps, bowls and pots. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Another hobby I would like to mention is that I like to paint my nails every week! I have over 18 bottles of nail polish (as of 2024) and I will continue to grow that number!</p>
